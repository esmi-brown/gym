<p>Strasbourg is situated at the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the Rhine, which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town Kehl. The historic core of Strasbourg, however, lies on the Grande Île in the river Ill, which here flows parallel to, and roughly 4 kilometres (2.5 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.
  </p><p>The city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, at between 132 metres (433 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) and 151 metres (495 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) above sea level, with the upland areas of the Vosges Mountains some 20 <abbr title="kilometres">km</abbr> (12 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) to the west and the Black Forest 25 km (16 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) to the east. This section of the Rhine valley is a major axis of north–south travel, with river traffic on the Rhine itself, and major roads and railways paralleling it on both banks.
</p>
<p>The city is some 397 kilometres (247 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) east of Paris. The mouth of the Rhine lies approximately 450 kilometres (280 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) to the north, or 650 kilometres (400 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) as the river flows, whilst the head of navigation in Basel is some 100 kilometres (62 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) to the south, or 150 kilometres (93 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) by river.
